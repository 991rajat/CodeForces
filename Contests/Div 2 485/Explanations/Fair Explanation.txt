The number of colours k is quite small (at most 100).

For each colour, remember which vertices have that colour. 

Then push all those vertices into a queue, and perform BFS and calculate the minimum distance of that colour for all vertices. 

(You can't necessarily perform DFS as it is a general graph and not always a tree.)

Then for each vertex you will have the minimum distance to each of the k colours. 

Sort them and find the sum of the smallest s of them. 

Complexity = O(k(m + n) + k log k)
