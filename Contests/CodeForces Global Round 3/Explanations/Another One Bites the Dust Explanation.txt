We will match all the As with Bs and then append all the 'AB's. 

If we have an extra A, we will put it at the end. 

If we have an extra B, we will put it at the beginning.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    long long A, B, AB;
    cin >> A >> B >> AB;

    long long answer = (B != A ? 1 + 2*AB + 2*min(A, B) : 2*min(A, B) + 2*AB);
    cout << answer;

    return 0;
}
