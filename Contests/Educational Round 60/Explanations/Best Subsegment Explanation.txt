Fact - The arithmetic mean of any segment cannot be greater than the maximum integer in the array. 

Proof - 

(a1 + a2 + ... + aN) = M x N, where M is the mean. 

If M > max{a1, ... , aN}, then M x N will be greater than (a1 + a2 + ... + aN), which is not possible. 

--------

Now, which segments have the mean = Max ?

Those segments that ONLY have the max element. 

Now, the question has reduced to finding the longest segment of the array consisting of the given element x.

------------

int main()
{
    int no_of_elements;
    cin >> no_of_elements;

    vector <int> A(no_of_elements + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
        cin >> A[i];

    int maximum = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
        maximum = max(maximum, A[i]);

    int max_longest_segment = 0, longest_segment_here = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        if(A[i] != maximum)
        {
            longest_segment_here = 0;
        }
        else
        {
            longest_segment_here++;

            max_longest_segment = max(max_longest_segment, longest_segment_here);
        }
    }

    cout << max_longest_segment;
    return 0;
}
