A 2x3 block can be tiled in two ways. 

2 2     2 2
1 2 and 2 1
1 1     1 1

In whatever way we place the first block, the second block will have to be placed in the way above. 
This shows that we will always be filing blocks of 2x3 at a time. If n is odd, then nx3 cannot be tiled. 

If it is 3xn, then there are n/2 blocks of 2 if n is even. 

So the number of tilings is 2^{n/2}

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    long long no_of_fillings  = (n%2 == 1 ? 0 : (1LL << (n/2)) );
    cout << no_of_fillings;

    return 0;
}
