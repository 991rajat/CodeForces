We want to divide the N numbers - 1, 2, 3, ... , N into N - 2 triplets (a, b, c) such that the sum of the products of abc is minimum

1. Each side must occur in at least one triplet. 

---

If we want to minimise the sum, we need to ensure that the smallest element - 1, is present in each triplet. 

Now each triplet is really the product of 2 integers. We want to minimise the product. 

So, we will pair 2 with 3. Pairing 2 with any other number will yield a greater product. 

Then, by the same logic we will pair 3 with 4, 

4 with 5 and so on.

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int weight = 0;
    for(int i = 3; i <= n; i++)
        weight += i*(i - 1);

    cout << weight;
    return 0;
