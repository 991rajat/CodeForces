When we are at day i, we will keep on going till A[i] at least. So the target for the day is always maximum of max(target, A[i]). 

If we have reached i, and i is the current target, then we will increment the number of days as we will close for the day.

int main()
{
    int no_of_pages;
    cin >> no_of_pages;

    vector <int> page(no_of_pages + 1, 0);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_pages; i++)
        cin >> page[i];

    int no_of_days = 0, day_target = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_pages; i++)
    {
        day_target = max(day_target, page[i]);

        if(day_target == i)
        {
            day_target = 0;

            no_of_days++;
        }
    }

    cout << no_of_days;
    return 0;
}
