Little Petya loves presents. His mum bought him two strings of the same size for his birthday. The strings consist of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. 
Now Petya wants to compare those two strings lexicographically. The letters' case does not matter, 
that is an uppercase letter is considered equivalent to the corresponding lowercase letter. Help Petya perform the comparison.

-------------------------------------------------------

Maybe if I had more time, I would make both strings lower character and then use strcmp so that there's no abrupt end ... But I wanted to finish this as soon as possible.

#define tolower(c) (c < 'a' ? (c + 'a' - 'A') : c)

int main()
{
    char string_1[MAX_LENGTH], string_2[MAX_LENGTH];
    scanf("%s %s", string_1, string_2);

    for(int i = 0; string_1[i] != '\0'; i++)
    {
        if(tolower(string_1[i]) > tolower(string_2[i]) )
        {
            printf("1\n");
            return 0;
        }
        else if(tolower(string_1[i]) < tolower(string_2[i]) )
        {
            printf("-1\n");
            return 0;
        }
    }

    printf("0\n");
    return 0;
}
