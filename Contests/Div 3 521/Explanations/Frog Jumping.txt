The total displacement towards right is positive, and left is negative. 

The answer is their difference.

All we need to do is calculate the number of jumps in either direction and then the displacement in both directions.


void solve()
{
    long long left_jump, right_jump, total_jumps;
    cin >> right_jump >> left_jump >> total_jumps;

    long long no_of_right_jumps = total_jumps/2 + total_jumps%2;
    long long no_of_left_jumps = total_jumps/2;

    long long right_distance = no_of_right_jumps*right_jump;
    long long left_distance = no_of_left_jumps*left_jump;

    long long distance = right_distance - left_distance;
    cout << distance << "\n";
}
