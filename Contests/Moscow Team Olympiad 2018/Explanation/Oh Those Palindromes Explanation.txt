It is always optimal to print chunks of each character together. 

(One way of doing this is by simply sorting the string.)

-----------

Why is it optimal ?

Every palindrome will have at least two characters.

Suppose a certain character occurs f times. 

Then it can be involved in at most C(f, 2) + C(f, 1) = f(f + 1)/2  palindromes.

We get C(f, 2) whenever this character is the end points of any palindrome
We get C(f, 1) whenever we have a 1-character palindrome.


When they are all printed together there will be f(f + 1)/2 palindromes. 

Palindrome of length 1, 2, 3, ... , f

int main()
{
    string S;
    int length;
    cin >> length >> S;

    sort(S, S + length);
    printf("%s\n", S);
    return 0;
