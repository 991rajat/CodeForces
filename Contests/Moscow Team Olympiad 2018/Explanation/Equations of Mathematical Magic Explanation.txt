We want all x that satisfy the following equation - 

a - x = a^x

Let us look at a from the last bit onwards

Suppose the last bit of a is 1, then the last bit of x can 1

1 - 1 = 1^1 = 0

It can also be 0 

1 - 0 = 1^0 = 1

What if the last bit of a is 0 ?

Then last bit of x can be 0

0 - 0 = 0^0 = 0

Suppose the last bit of a is 0 and the last bit of x is 1. What happens ?

Let us look at the leftmost 1 in a. All the bits till this leftmost 1 are toggled. 

For example if fifth bit is the leftmost 1 and after that there are 4 0s. 

If we subtract 1 from the first bit, the the other four bits in A are toggled. 

Now whatever the value of x is for bits 2, 3, 4, 5 ... A - x cannot be equal to A^x because the bits of A are different here now. 

---------------

Hence, there are two possibilites for every 1 and only one possibility for every 0.
