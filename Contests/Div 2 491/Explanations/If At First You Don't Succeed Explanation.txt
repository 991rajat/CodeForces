OKay, so the conditions that contradict the data is if 

C > min(A, B). The number of students who go to both A and B cannot be less than the students who go to both. 

I missed this. 

and if failed < 1. 

No need of explicitly checking if A + B - C > 0, because that would cause failed to become < 1 anyway.

(If there are a negative number of students, there are a negative number of failed students too.)

int main()
{
    int A, B, C, total_students;
    cin >> A >> B >> C >> total_students;

    int passed = (A + B - C);
    int failed = total_students - passed;

    cout << (failed < 1 || C > min(A, B) ? -1 : failed);

    return 0;
}
