It is always better to buy the liter as early as possible as we will pay more for the same amount as time goes on. 

We will be greedy. We will first buy v literes in first city

Then, we will go to each city and buy only one liter, and make sure the capacity is full. 

We will not refill, if the remaining journey x, is smaller than the the fuel we have v.


-------------------

Of course, if we capacity is more than the number of cities, then we will only refuel n - 1 times.

int main()
{
    int no_of_cities, capacity;
    cin >> no_of_cities >> capacity;

    int fuel;
    if(capacity >= no_of_cities - 1)
    {
        fuel = no_of_cities - 1;
    }
    else
    {
        fuel = capacity - 1;

        for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_cities - capacity; i++)
            fuel += i;
    }

    cout << fuel;
    return 0;
