If the queen is in between the king and the target, then the king can never reach the target square as an entire row or column is blocked. 

However, otherwise the king can always reach his target since an entire row/column can't be blocked. There will always be squares.

    int queen_middle_x = in_middle(king_x, queen_x, center_x);
    int queen_middle_y = in_middle(king_y, queen_y, center_y);

    printf(queen_middle_x || queen_middle_y ? "NO\n" : "YES\n");
