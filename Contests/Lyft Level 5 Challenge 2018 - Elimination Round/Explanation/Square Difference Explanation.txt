The number N = A^2 - B^2

N = (A - B)(A + B)


This is always composite unless one of these two terms = 1 and the other is prime. 

Now only A - B can be = 1, because both are positive integers. 

All we need to check is if A + B = 1

    long long a, b;
    scanf("%I64d %I64d", &a, &b);
    printf(a - b == 1 && is_prime(a + b) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
