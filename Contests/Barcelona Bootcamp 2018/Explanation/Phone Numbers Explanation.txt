We can have at most N/11 strings. 
The number of strings can't be more than the number of 8s. 

If the number of 8s > N/11, then there will be N/11 strings.
If N/11 > number of 8s, then there will be as many strings as there are 8s. 

In total number of strings = min(number of 8s, N/11)

-----------------------

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

#define min(a, b) (a < b ? a : b)
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int length;
    string S;
    cin >> length >> S;

    int no_of_8 = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)
        no_of_8 += (S[i] == '8');

    cout << min(no_of_8, length/11) << endl;
    return 0;
}
