While Mahmoud and Ehab were practicing for IOI, they found a problem which name was Longest common subsequence. 
They solved it, and then Ehab challenged Mahmoud with another problem.

Given two strings a and b, find the length of their longest uncommon subsequence, which is the longest string that is a subsequence of one of them and
 not a subsequence of the other.

A subsequence of some string is a sequence of characters that appears in the same order in the string, The appearances don't have to be consecutive, 
for example, strings "ac", "bc", "abc" and "a" are subsequences of string "abc" while strings "abbc" and "acb" are not. 
The empty string is a subsequence of any string. Any string is a subsequence of itself.

If the strings are not equal, then the longest uncommon subsequence is the larger string.
If they are equal, there is no uncommon subsequence.

printf("%d\n", (strcmp(string_1, string_2) != 0 ? max( strlen(string_1),strlen(string_2) ) : -1) );
