You are given n points on a line with their coordinates xi. Find the point x so the sum of distances to the given points is minimal.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The median minimises the distance. 

If there is a sorted list of n elements, x1 x2 ... xn, then the element at position n/2 is the median. 

Let us prove that the median has the least distance to all the points. 

Case 1: n is even,

If there are two points x1, and x2, the answer is one of these points. 

(|xn - x| + |x1 - x|) + (|x(n-1) - x| + |x2 - x|) + ... + (|x(n/2) - x|  + |x(n/2+1) - x)|)

The point that minimises this distance must lie inside each of these intervals. The two medians satisfy this property.

Case 2: n is odd.

Let there be 3 elements - x1, x2 and x3. Here, the minimum sum of distances from one point to the other 2 is by x2. 

As we add pairs of points to this set - one at the extreme right and one at the extreme left. By the same logic, if there are 2n + 1 points, and we split it into 
n pairs and xm, where xm is the median, xm is the only point that lies inside every interval. So, it minimises the distance.

-------------------------------

    sort(points, points + no_of_points);
    median = points[(no_of_points - 1)/2];

Array is indexed from 0. So, we consider (n-1)/2 Instead of n/2 since the last element is (n-1)
