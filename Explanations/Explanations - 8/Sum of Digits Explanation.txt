Having watched the last Harry Potter film, little Gerald also decided to practice magic. 
He found in his father's magical book a spell that turns any number in the sum of its digits. 
At the moment Gerald learned that, he came across a number n. How many times can Gerald put a spell on it until the number becomes one-digit?

----------------------------------------------

This is similar to the big GCD problem ... We only need to use big numbers once ...

If the initial number is 10^ ... the digit sum can't be greater than 9x10^5, and then can't be bigger than 54 and then one more ... So, since the number of spells can be 
at most 4, first find digit sum on the string and then use the normal digit sum function.

Single digit numbers require 0 spells.

------------------------------------------

   if(number[1] != '\0')
    {
        for(i = 0; number[i] != '\0'; i++)
            digit_sum += (number[i] - '0');

        no_of_spells = 1;
        while(digit_sum >= 10)
        {
            no_of_spells++;
            digit_sum = find_digit_sum(digit_sum);
        }
    }
