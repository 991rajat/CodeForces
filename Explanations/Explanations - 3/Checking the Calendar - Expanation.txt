You are given names of two days of the week.

Please, determine whether it is possible that during some non-leap year the first day of some month was equal to the first day of the week you are given, 
while the first day of the next month was equal to the second day of the week you are given. Both months should belong to one year.

In this problem, we consider the Gregorian calendar to be used. The number of months in this calendar is equal to 12. 
The number of days in months during any non-leap year is: 31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31.

Names of the days of the week are given with lowercase English letters: "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday".

Input
The input consists of two lines, each of them containing the name of exactly one day of the week. 
It's guaranteed that each string in the input is from the set "monday", "tuesday", "wednesday", "thursday", "friday", "saturday", "sunday".

Output
Print "YES" (without quotes) if such situation is possible during some non-leap year. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).

Let a month begin on day 1 and have x days. x = 7q + r, r is a number less than 7. The day 7q + 1 will have the same day of the week as the first day
The next month begins at day r + 1. The difference in between 1(mod 7) and the allowable values of (r + 1) give us the answer.
    
All days of a week get a number assigned to them from 1 - 7 in the order they appear in the week. We only consider the (day2 - day1) mod 7.
However, we don't want negative values, so (2-5) mod 7 should be 4 not -3. So, for computer implementation, write (day2 - day1 + 7) mod 7.

1.If the month has 31 days, then 31 = 4(7) + 3. The first day is on 1(mod 7). The next month's first day is on 4(mod 7). So, difference of 3 is allowed
 2.IF the month has 30 = 4(7) + 2. A difference of 2 is allowed
3. If the month has 28 = 7(4) days. Both the first days are on 1(mod 7) so a difference of 0 is allowed.
