We can go from one point to another if either the x-coordinate or y-coordinate is the same. 

Let us make a graph with the points as vertices and draw an edge between two points if one can be reached from the other. 

This graph will have a set of connected components. We need to connect all these components together. 

To connect any two components we need exactly one new point.
(For example with the x-coordinate of some point of one component and the y-coordinate of some point of the other component.)

int main()
{
    int no_of_points;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_points);

    vector <int> X(no_of_points + 1);
    vector <int> Y(no_of_points + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_points; i++)
        scanf("%d %d", &X[i], &Y[i]);

    int no_of_components = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_points; i++)
    {
        for(int j = 1; j < i; j++)
        {
            if(X[i] == X[j] || Y[i] == Y[j])
            {
                graph[i].push_back(j);
                graph[j].push_back(i);
            }
        }
    }

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_points; i++)
    {
        if(!visited[i])
        {
            no_of_components++;

            dfs(i);
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", no_of_components - 1);
    return 0;
}
