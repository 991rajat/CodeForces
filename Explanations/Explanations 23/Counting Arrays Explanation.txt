Firstly, let us try to count the number of ways to factorise into positive integers. 

This is equal to the number of ways of distributing each prime factor into y factors. 

We use stars and bars for each prime. 

int x, no_of_summands;
    cin >> x >> no_of_summands;

    map <int, int> prime_exponents;
    factorise(x, prime_exponents);

    long long answer = 1;
    for(map <int, int> :: iterator it = prime_exponents.begin(); it != prime_exponents.end(); it++)
    {
        int exponent = it->second;

        answer *= choose(no_of_summands + exponent - 1, no_of_summands - 1);

        answer %= MOD;
    }

-----------------------------

Now, after this we need to make an even number of integers even. 

C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + ... C(n, 2m), where 2m <= n and 2m + 1 >= n

This is equal to 2^{n - 1}

long long ways_to_distribute_signs = power_mod(2, no_of_summands - 1);

    answer = (answer*ways_to_distribute_signs)%MOD;%= MOD;
