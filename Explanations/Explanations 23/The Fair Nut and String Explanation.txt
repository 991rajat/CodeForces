Every alphabet other than 'a' and 'b' does not matter. We might as well delete it. 

Whenever we have a block of 'a' ... We may choose a single 'a' from it or not choose any 'a'. 

Each block is independent. The answer is Prod(Block_size + 1) - 1

We subtract 1 because we have also counted the empty sequence.
