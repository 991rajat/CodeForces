
If x < y, then x (mod y) = x itself.

Now, in this problem m (mod 2^n) m and n can be upto 10^8, 2^n overflows integer data type at value 32.

All we need to notice that if 2^n > 10^8, then the answer will always be m as m is never greater than 10^8.

This happens quite quickly. (At n = 28 itself).

#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
    int n, m;
    scanf("%d %d", &n, &m);

    int answer = (n > 31 ? m : m%(1 << n));
    printf("%d ", answer);
    return 0;
}
