
Let's say we have crossed x levels, how many clicks to we make on level x+1 with k options ?

We have already crossed x levels, so we make 1 click, which will be wrong in the worst case.

Now, after that to reach level x + 1, we will need to make x clicks. 

So, for each of the remaining k - 1 options, we will need x clicks to get there and one more click for the option itself.

So, number of clicks at level x + 1 = 1 + (x + 1)(k - 1)

First option requires one click and all remaining options require x + 1 clicks.


So, if we are now at level i,

Clicks += 1 + i(k - 1)

int main()
{
    int no_of_questions;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_questions);

    long long no_of_clicks = 0;

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_questions; i++)
    {
        int no_of_options;
        scanf("%d", &no_of_options);

        no_of_clicks += 1 + i*1LL*(no_of_options - 1);
    }

    printf("%I64d\n", no_of_clicks);
    return 0;
}
