With that begins the watch of Jon Snow. He is assigned the task to support the stewards.

This time he has n stewards with him whom he has to provide support. Each steward has his own strength. 
Jon Snow likes to support a steward only if there exists at least one steward who has strength strictly less than him and at least one steward who has 
strength strictly greater than him.

Can you find how many stewards will Jon support?

--------------------------------------------

The minimum strength and the maximum cannot be supported. Keep track of their frequency.

int main()
{
    const int oo = 1e9 + 1;
    int no_of_people, min_strength = oo, max_strength = 0;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_people);

    map <int, int> strength_frequency;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_people; i++)
    {
        int strength_i;
        scanf("%d", &strength_i);

        strength_frequency[strength_i]++;
        min_strength = min(strength_i, min_strength);
        max_strength = max(strength_i, max_strength);
    }

    int number_of_people_supported = max(0, no_of_people - strength_frequency[max_strength] - strength_frequency[min_strength]);
    printf("%d\n", number_of_people_supported);
    return 0;
