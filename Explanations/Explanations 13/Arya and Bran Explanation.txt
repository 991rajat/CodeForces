Bran and his older sister Arya are from the same house. Bran like candies so much, so Arya is going to give him some Candies.

At first, Arya and Bran have 0 Candies. There are n days, at the i-th day, Arya finds ai candies in a box, that is given by the Many-Faced God. 
Every day she can give Bran at most 8 of her candies. If she don't give him the candies at the same day, they are saved for her and she can give them to him later.

Your task is to find the minimum number of days Arya needs to give Bran k candies before the end of the n-th day. 
Formally, you need to output the minimum day index to the end of which k candies will be given out (the days are indexed from 1 to n).

Print -1 if she can't give him k candies during n given days.
--------------------------------------------

Keep track of the total candies Arya has. 
Every day give the min(8, total). 

Check if greater than k candies have been given any day.
