Little Vasya loves orange juice very much. That's why any food and drink in his kitchen necessarily contains orange juice. 
There are n drinks in his fridge, the volume fraction of orange juice in the i-th drink equals pi percent.

One day Vasya decided to make himself an orange cocktail. He took equal proportions of each of the n drinks and mixed them. 
Then he wondered, how much orange juice the cocktail has.

Find the volume fraction of orange juice in the final drink.
----------------------------------------------

The numerator is the sum of all percentages. The denominator is n.

Be careful about floating point precision errors. I typecasted everything to double before dividing.

int main()
{
    int no_of_drinks;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_drinks);

    double numerator = 0.0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_drinks; i++)
    {
        int percent_i;
        scanf("%d", &percent_i);

        numerator += percent_i;
    }

    double denominator = no_of_drinks*1.0;
    double fraction = numerator/denominator;

    printf("%lf\n", fraction);
    return 0;
}
