One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as si — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. 
Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. 
Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, 
such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.
---------------------------------------------------------

The number of balloons of any colour should not exceed the number of people. That forces one person to get balloons of the same colour by 
the pigeonhole principle.

    int no_of_balloons_of_colour[NO_OF_ALPHABETS] = {0};
    for(int i = 0; i < no_of_balloons; i++)
