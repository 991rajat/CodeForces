The hero of our story, Valera, and his best friend Arcady are still in school, and therefore they spend all the free time playing turn-based strategy 
"GAGA: Go And Go Again". The gameplay is as follows.

There are two armies on the playing field each of which consists of n men (n is always even). 
The current player specifies for each of her soldiers an enemy's soldier he will shoot (a target) and then all the player's soldiers shot simultaneously. 
This is a game world, and so each soldier shoots perfectly, that is he absolutely always hits the specified target. If an enemy soldier is hit, he will surely die.
 It may happen that several soldiers had been indicated the same target. Killed soldiers do not participate in the game anymore.

The game "GAGA" consists of three steps: first Valera makes a move, then Arcady, then Valera again and the game ends.

You are asked to calculate the maximum total number of soldiers that may be killed during the game.

-------------------------------------------------------

This is one of those problems that's a lot harder to prove than to code ... 

To maximise the number of killed soldiers, both sides will have to kill as many soldiers as possible ... 

Notice that if there were only 2 turns, then n soldiers will always be killed no matter what.

Proof - If the first side kills all n soldiers on it's turn, then n soldiers are killed and there are no alive soldiers on the other side for turn 2.

If the first side kills k soldiers, .... then the n-k surviving soldiers will all kill 1 soldiers each. They have to do this because they only get 1 turn.

So, number of soldiers dead after 2 turns = k + (n - k) = n.

--------------------------------

Now, on turn 3 ... the number of soldiers killed has to be maximised ... This is the strategy that needs to be optimised...

For this, side 1 has to kill half of side 2's soldiers on it's first turn...

IF side 1 kills less than half of their soldiers ... Then after all of side 2's soldiers kill a soldier ... side 1 will not have enough soldiers to completely kill side 1.

If they killed more than half of their soldiers, then after two turns it would be n + r ... r < n/2 [r is all the people killed on turn 3 - survivors of side 1]
... The way to maximise r is to set r = n/2.  If r is greater, we get a less than optimal result.

---------------------------------------------

Ans = n + n/2 = 3n/2 ... if n is even ... If n is odd then n/2 is rounded off to the higher side ... 

------------------------------------------

int main()
{
    int number_of_soldiers, killed;
    scanf("%d", &number_of_soldiers);

    killed = 3*((number_of_soldiers + 1)/2);
    printf("%d\n", killed);
    return 0;
}
