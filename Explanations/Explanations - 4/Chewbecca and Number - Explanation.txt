Luke Skywalker gave Chewbacca an integer number x. Chewbacca isn't good at numbers but he loves inverting digits in them. 
Inverting digit t means replacing it with digit 9?-?t.

Help Chewbacca to transform the initial number x to the minimum possible positive number by inverting some (possibly, zero) digits. 
The decimal representation of the final number shouldn't start with a zero.

Input
The first line contains a single integer x (1?=?x?=?10^{18}) — the number that Luke Skywalker gave to Chewbacca.

Output
Print the minimum possible positive number that Chewbacca can obtain after inverting some digits. The number shouldn't contain leading zeroes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

All digits from 5-9 have to be inverted. Everything else is untouched.
The first digit shouldn't be inverted if it's a 9 since leading 0s aren't allowed.
