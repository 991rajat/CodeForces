Anastasia loves going for a walk in Central Uzhlyandian Park. But she became uninterested in simple walking, so she began to collect Uzhlyandian pebbles. 
At first, she decided to collect all the pebbles she could find in the park.

She has only two pockets. She can put at most k pebbles in each pocket at the same time. 
There are n different pebble types in the park, and there are wi pebbles of the i-th type. 
Anastasia is very responsible, so she never mixes pebbles of different types in same pocket. 
However, she can put different kinds of pebbles in different pockets at the same time. 
Unfortunately, she can't spend all her time collecting pebbles, so she can collect pebbles from the park only once a day.

Help her to find the minimum number of days needed to collect all the pebbles of Uzhlyandian Central Park, 
taking into consideration that Anastasia can't place pebbles of different types in same pocket.

----------------------------------------------

First imagine that there's only one pocket ... How long will it take to pick up wi pebbles ? 

ceil(wi/k) ...


Now we have two pockets ... No of days = ceil(no of pebbles/2)

----------------------------------------------------

int main()
{
    int no_of_pebble_types, pebble_limit;
    scanf("%d %d", &no_of_pebble_types, &pebble_limit);

    int days_to_collect_all_pebbles = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_pebble_types; i++)
    {
        int pebble_i;
        scanf("%d", &pebble_i);

        days_to_collect_all_pebbles += pebble_i/pebble_limit + (pebble_i%pebble_limit != 0); //Ceil
    }
    days_to_collect_all_pebbles = days_to_collect_all_pebbles/2 + days_to_collect_all_pebbles%2;

    printf("%d\n", days_to_collect_all_pebbles);
    return 0;
}
