Santa Claus has n candies, he dreams to give them as gifts to children.

What is the maximal number of children for whose he can give candies if Santa Claus want each kid should get distinct positive integer number of candies. 
Santa Class wants to give all n candies he has.

-----------------------------------------------

The number of people who get gifts is equal to the greatest triangular number smaller than n. 

The strategy I used for distribution was for person i = 1 to p - 1, give p - 1 gifts and give all remaining gifts to the last person.

--------------------------------

int main()
{
    int no_of_gifts;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_gifts);

    int no_of_people = 1;
    while(no_of_people*(no_of_people + 1) <= 2*no_of_gifts)
        no_of_people++;

    no_of_people--;

    printf("%d\n", no_of_people);
    for(int i = 1; i < no_of_people; i++)
    {
        printf("%d ", i);
        no_of_gifts -= i;
    }

    printf("%d\n", no_of_gifts); //Last person gets all remaining gifts
    return 0;
}
