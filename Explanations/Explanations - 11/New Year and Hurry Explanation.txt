Limak is going to participate in a contest on the last day of the 2016. The contest will start at 20:00 and will last four hours, exactly until midnight. 
There will be n problems, sorted by difficulty, i.e. problem 1 is the easiest and problem n is the hardest. 
Limak knows it will take him 5·i minutes to solve the i-th problem.

Limak's friends organize a New Year's Eve party and Limak wants to be there at midnight or earlier. He needs k minutes to get there from his house, 
where he will participate in the contest first.

How many problems can Limak solve if he wants to make it to the party?

--------------------------------------------

First subtract k from total time (4 hours).

Solve as many problems as you can (either the time is insufficient for the problem or all the problems have been solved).

Go through the problems with i = 1 to n, Check if time - 5i >= 0, then it can be solved (Solve the problem and then reduce the time)

I forgot to reduce the time the first time.

-----------------------------------

int main()
{
    int travel_time, no_of_problems;
    scanf("%d %d", &no_of_problems, &travel_time);

    const int NO_OF_MINUTES_IN_HOUR = 60;
    int time = 4*NO_OF_MINUTES_IN_HOUR;

    time = time - travel_time;

    int solved_problems = 0;

    for(int problem_i = 1; problem_i <= no_of_problems; problem_i++)
    {
        if(time - 5*problem_i >= 0)
        {
            time = time - 5*problem_i;
            solved_problems++;
        }
        else //Time is insufficient
        {
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", solved_problems);
    return 0;
}
