The country of Byalechinsk is running elections involving n candidates. The country consists of m cities. We know how many people in each city voted for each candidate.

The electoral system in the country is pretty unusual. At the first stage of elections the votes are counted for each city: 
it is assumed that in each city won the candidate who got the highest number of votes in this city, and if several candidates got the maximum number of votes, 
then the winner is the one with a smaller index.

At the second stage of elections the winner is determined by the same principle over the cities: 
the winner of the elections is the candidate who won in the maximum number of cities, and among those who got the maximum number of cities the winner is the one with 
a smaller index.

Determine who will win the elections.

------------------------------------

I misunderstood this question. It isn't the person with the greatest number of total votes. It's the person who won in the most number of cities.

A tricky test case was when everybody got 0 votes. The winner has to be candidate 1, then.

int main()
{
    int no_of_candidates, no_of_cities;
    scanf("%d %d", &no_of_candidates, &no_of_cities);

    vector <int> no_of_wins_for(no_of_candidates + 1, 0);
    for(int city_i = 1; city_i <= no_of_cities; city_i++)
    {
        int round_winner = 1, winner_votes = 0; //If everyone gets 0 votes, the first candidate must win.

        for(int candidate_i = 1; candidate_i <= no_of_candidates; candidate_i++)
        {
            int votes;
            scanf("%d", &votes);

            if(votes > winner_votes)
            {
                round_winner = candidate_i;
                winner_votes = votes;
            }
        }

        no_of_wins_for[round_winner]++;
    }

    int winner = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_candidates; i++)
        if(no_of_wins_for[i] > no_of_wins_for[winner])
            winner = i;

    printf("%d\n", winner);
    return 0;
