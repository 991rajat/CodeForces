Let us iterate over the divisors of n. 

For each pair of factors (f1, f2) such that f1 x f2 = n, 

One will be the quotient and one will the remainder. 

We need to check if the remainder is smaller than k, of course. 

And then among all such values we set x to the minimum.

int main()
{
    int n, k;
    cin >> n >> k;

    const int oo = 1e9;
    int answer = oo;

    for(int i = 1; i*i <= n; i++)
    {
        if(n%i == 0)
        {
            int quotient = i, remainder = n/i;

            if(remainder < k)
                answer = min(answer, quotient*k + remainder);

            quotient = n/i, remainder = i;
            if(remainder < k)
                answer = min(answer, quotient*k + remainder);
        }
    }

    cout << answer;
    return 0;
}
