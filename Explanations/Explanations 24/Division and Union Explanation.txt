Let us sort the segments by their endings. 

Then for some segment Si, we know that all segments from [i + 1, ... , n] have their endings after Si. 

If we know that the smallest beginning is also after Si, then we can place [1, 2, ... , i] in one group and the remaining segments in the other group. 

Alternatively, we could also sort by beginnings and then check for some i, if the largest ending in [1, 2, ... , i - 1] is before the beginning of Si. 

If no such segment i exists, then it means the segments are all connected and two such groups are not possible.
