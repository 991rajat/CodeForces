The fraction is finite, if gcd(p, q) = 1 and q | b^k. 

Let us keep dividing denominator by base to determine if there are prime factors in q that are not in b. 

-----------------

void solve()
{
    LL numerator, denominator, base;
    scanf("%I64d %I64d %I64d", &numerator, &denominator, &base);

    LL gcd_fraction = gcd(numerator, denominator);
    numerator /= gcd_fraction;
    denominator /= gcd_fraction;

    base = gcd(base, denominator);

    while(base > 1)
    {
        while(denominator%base == 0) denominator /= base;

        base = gcd(base, denominator);
    }

    printf(denominator == 1 ? "Finite\n" : "Infinite\n");
}
