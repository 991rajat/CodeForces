Bear Limak likes watching sports on TV. He is going to watch a game today. The game lasts 90 minutes and there are no breaks.

Each minute can be either interesting or boring. If 15 consecutive minutes are boring then Limak immediately turns TV off.

---------------------------------------

Missed a case which was not explained in the question clearly.

If he doesn't find any gap of boring minutes greater than 15 minutes, then the bear watches 90 minutes.

The number of boring minutes in between two interesting moments x and y are all the moments from x + 1 to y - 1 ... This is given by (y- 1) - x 
[Inclusive of y - 1, exclusive of x].

I put in 2 auxilliary variables .. The 0-th interesting minute is 0  and the last interesting minute is 90. (Even if it is boring).

---------------------------------------

int main()
{
    int no_of_interesting_minutes, interesting_minute_i, tv_on_minutes = 0;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_interesting_minutes);

    bool tv_on = true;

    vector <int> interesting_minute;
    interesting_minute.push_back(0);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_interesting_minutes; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &interesting_minute_i);
        interesting_minute.push_back(interesting_minute_i);
    }

    if(interesting_minute.back() != 90)
        interesting_minute.push_back(90);

    for(unsigned int i = 1; i < interesting_minute.size() ; i++)
    {
        if(tv_on)
        {
            int boring_interval = (interesting_minute[i] - 1) - interesting_minute[i - 1];

            if(boring_interval >= 15)
            {
                tv_on_minutes += 15;
                tv_on = false;
            }
            else
            {
                tv_on_minutes += boring_interval + 1; //Watch the boring interval + the interesting minute
            }
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", tv_on_minutes);
    return 0;
}
