
is a system which allows to create programming tasks in a simple and professional way. 
When you add a test to the problem, the corresponding form asks you for the test index. 
As in most cases it is clear which index the next test will have, the system suggests the default value of the index. 
It is calculated as the smallest positive integer which is not used as an index for some previously added test.

You are to implement this feature. Create a program which determines the default index of the next test, given the indexes of the previously added tests.

--------------------------------------

Used a frequency table here since the least number is required.

Got a mistake because it is possible for the answer to be 3001 ... if all 3000 numbers are used.

Missed a corner case on this one.

------------------------------------------

int main()
{
    vector <int> is_used(3000 + 2, false);
    int no_of_tests, test_i, default_for_next;
    scanf("%d", &no_of_tests);

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_tests; i++)
    {
        scanf("%d", &test_i);
        is_used[test_i] = true;
    }

    for(int i = 1; i <= 3001; i++)
    {
        if(is_used[i] == false)
        {
            default_for_next = i;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf("%d\n", default_for_next);
    return 0;
}
