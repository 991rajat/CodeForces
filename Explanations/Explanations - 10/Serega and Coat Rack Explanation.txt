Sereja owns a restaurant for n people. The restaurant hall has a coat rack with n hooks. Each restaurant visitor can use a hook to hang his clothes on it. 
Using the i-th hook costs ai rubles. Only one person can hang clothes on one hook.

Tonight Sereja expects m guests in the restaurant. Naturally, each guest wants to hang his clothes on an available hook with minimum price 
(if there are multiple such hooks, he chooses any of them). 
However if the moment a guest arrives the rack has no available hooks, Sereja must pay a d ruble fine to the guest.

Help Sereja find out the profit in rubles (possibly negative) that he will get tonight. You can assume that before the guests arrive, 
all hooks on the rack are available, all guests come at different time, nobody besides the m guests is visiting Sereja's restaurant tonight.

-----------------------------------------

Sort all the hook prices.

Count the number of unhappy guests = max(guests - hooks, 0)

It it guests - hooks, if guests is greater and 0 if hooks is greater.

All the unhappy guests collect a fine.
