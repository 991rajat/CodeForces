One cold April morning Panoramix predicted that soon Kakofonix will break free from his straitjacket, and this will be a black day for the residents of the Gallic countryside.

Panoramix's prophecy tells that if some day Asterix and Obelix beat exactly x Roman soldiers, where x is a prime number, and next day they beat exactly y Roman soldiers,
 where y is the next prime number after x, 
then it's time to wait for Armageddon, for nothing can shut Kakofonix up while he sings his infernal song.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Just check if there's no primes in between and y is also a prime.

int main()
{
    int x, y;
    scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);

    int prime_in_middle = false;
    for(int i = x + 1; i < y; i++)
    {
        if(is_prime(i))
        {
            prime_in_middle = true;
            break;
        }
    }

    printf(!prime_in_middle && is_prime(y) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
    return 0;
}
