
Think of the path travelled in terms of the edges travelled. 

What if we had only one vertex and all of it's children were leafs ? 

Then cost = w1 + w2 + ... + wn .... Now, all except one of these leaves are visited twice. 

So, the best we can do is visit the maximum weight only once. Cost = 2(w1 + w2 + ... + wn) - wmax

Now, we don't necessarily have all children as leaves. 

But, notice that from the root, we must visit every leaf. The cost to one leaf is f(L)

f(L1) + f(L2) + ... + f(Ln)

All except one leaf is visited twice. Let us visit the leaf with the maximum cost once. 

Total cost = 2*sum of edges - f(max)

This is an elegant way of putting it. 

A very important corner case, which fortunately is elaborated in the example itself - What if there is only one leaf ?
Then, no edge will be visited twice as we don't need to come back to any vertex and visit the other vertices and the answer is merely the sum of all edges.
