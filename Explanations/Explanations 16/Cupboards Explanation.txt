
Keep track of the open doors on the left and right. 
The number of operations on either side is whichever position occurs less times. 
The answer is the sum of the right and left.

int main()

    while(no_of_cupboards--)
	{
		int left, right;
		scanf("%d %d", &left, &right);

		left_open_doors += (left == OPEN);
		left_closed_doors += (left == CLOSED);

		right_open_doors += (right == OPEN);
		right_closed_doors += (right == CLOSED);

	int minimum_right_operations = min(right_open_doors, right_closed_doors);

	printf("%d\n", minimum_left_operations + minimum_right_operations);
