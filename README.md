This repository contains all my solutions to questions from CodeForces. The folder 'Explanation' consists of text files which document
my take on the problem, the algorithm used and test cases where the program didn't work initially.

The actual working programs are also available.

For simplicity of viewing, I have tried to ensure that no folder has more than 25 files.
