# CodeForces

Codeforces is a Russian website dedicated to competitive programming. It was created and is maintained by a group of competitive programmers from Saratov State University led by Mikhail Mirzayanov. 

It has an extensive problem archive from it's previous contests. 
This repository contains all my solutions to questions from CodeForces. The folder 'Explanation' consists of text files which document
my take on the problem, the algorithm used and test cases where the program didn't work initially.

The actual working programs are also available.

For simplicity of viewing, I have tried to ensure that no folder has more than 25 files.
